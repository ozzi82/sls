      question: "What are trimless channel letters?",
      answer:
        "Trimless channel letters feature a flush-face design with no visible trim or seams around the face. The LED modules are fully enclosed within the letter, creating a clean, seamless appearance that's superior to traditional trim-cap construction.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the minimum stroke width for trimless letters?",
      answer:
        "Our trimless channel letters require a minimum stroke width of 1.5 inches to accommodate the LED modules and maintain structural integrity. For smaller text, we recommend our cast block acrylic letters.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your lead time from art approval?",
      answer:
        "Production and delivery is 21 days from final art approval. We provide production drawings and 3D renderings within 24–48 hours of order placement for your approval before manufacturing begins.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are your channel letters UL 48 listed?",
      answer:
        "Yes, all our channel letters use UL 48 listed LED modules and are manufactured to UL standards. We provide UL documentation with every order and include appropriate power supplies.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you ship to Canada?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we ship to both USA and Canada with ~21 day door-to-door delivery via freight carriers. Shipping costs are calculated based on weight, dimensions, and destination.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's included with every order?",
      answer:
        "Every order includes: production drawings, 3D day/night renderings, touch-up paint (for painted products), 1:1 installation patterns, power supplies (for LED products), and a comprehensive 3-year warranty.",
